## Overview
Mario graduated from the University of Miami with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering (Magna Cum Laude) and a minor in Mathematics. During his time as an undergrad, Mario participated in several different clubs and activities, including projects with SEDS, ASME, and EWB. Mario also spent several months under the mentorship of the head of the Aerospace department at his school performing research in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Outside of school Mario has obtained several internships, including a position at a Verizon owned company in charge of handling data centers, and a summer research opportunity with NASA.

Having learned a great deal during his undergraduate career, Mario now looks forward to continue developing his abilities at Northwestern. Combining his mechanical engineering experience with newly learned electrical and computer science knowledge, Mario hopes he can someday contribute to the fast paced, rapidly evolving field of robotics.
