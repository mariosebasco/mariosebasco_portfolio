## Overview
The objective of this project is to design a system that would allow a disabled person to traverse a set of stairs without aid from another individual. After completing pleliminary research on all the ideas presently available, it was decided that the mechanism to be used would be a mechanical wheelchair lift. Picked due to its structural integrity, relative inexpensiveness, and straighforward design, the final system can be viewed in the image displayed here. A prototype was built and tested to yield deflection and ascension rate results. Platform deflection results exceeded standard requirements and Solidworks assembly models were used to investigate the unexpected behavior. It is hypothesized that imprecise machining led to disparities in Solidworks models and prototype assembly. Replacement of some Aluminum components with steel are proposed for future work. Although Ascension rate is satisfactory and performs according to ISO standards, additional disengaging and descent components require further testing and implementation. Considerations taken into account include: Structural analysis of components subjected to high stresses, biomechanic factors to offer optimum input from the user, and force input variations for added versatility. Concluding, the paper serves as an interim report on the manual lift endeavor with proposals for future work and research.
